Project developed for the subject "Descriptive and Inferential Statistics" for the class taught in semester 2025-2.

# Introduction
The purpose of this work is to present the process carried out to perform the statistical analysis of the nutritional values (macronutrients) provided by the following diets: DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), keto, Mediterranean, paleo and vegan. The main focus is to answer whether there is a significant nutritional difference between the different diets.

# General Aim
Making use of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques and tools to test whether there is a significant difference in nutritional intake between the different diets. 

# Particular Aims
- Performing descriptive statistical analysis of the macronutrients in the different diets in order to characterize the nutritional intake.
- Conjecturing and testing hypotheses about the nutritional contributions of individual diets based on the behavior and definition of the diets.
- Proving if there is a significant difference in the nutritional contributions between the different diets for the creation of a recipe classification model based on the macronutrients they provide.

# About the Dataset 
The dataset is taken from [[1]](./README.md#references). The dataset contains information on the nutritional values of carbohydrates, proteins and fats of recipes from different international cuisines.
