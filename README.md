Project developed for the subject "Descriptive and Inferential Statistics" for the class taught in semester 2025-2.

## Introduction
The purpose of this work is to present the process carried out to perform the statistical analysis of the nutritional values (macronutrients) provided by the following diets: DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), keto, Mediterranean, paleo and vegan. The main focus is to answer whether there is a significant nutritional difference between the different diets.

## General Aim
Making use of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques and tools to test whether there is a significant difference in nutritional intake between the different diets. 

## Particular Aims
- Performing descriptive statistical analysis of the macronutrients in the different diets in order to characterize the nutritional intake.
- Conjecturing and testing hypotheses about the nutritional contributions of individual diets based on the behavior and definition of the diets.
- Proving if there is a significant difference in the nutritional contributions between the different diets for the creation of a recipe classification model based on the macronutrients they provide.

## About the Dataset 
The dataset is taken from [[1]](./README.md#references). The dataset contains information on the nutritional values of carbohydrates, proteins and fats of recipes from different international cuisines.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The process related to the preprocessing and exploration of the data can be found in [Exploratory Data Analysis](./StatisticalAnalysis/ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb), where the different plots, observations and comments made to obtain relevant information and insights on the data with which they are working, such as the expected behavior of the different diets with respect to the distribution of their macronutrients are presented. The most relevant aspect was the preprocessing of the data that allowed a better quality comparison and analysis between diets. From which questions and hypotheses were generated, which are resolved in the following section.
